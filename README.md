# Story of this game 📚

The Fox Game marks a significant milestone in my journey as a developer. This was my first-ever 2D game, created as I delved deeper into the world of game development. It all began when I discovered game development through a YouTube video (as shared in my 3D game project story). Inspired and curious, I spent months experimenting with tutorials and learning the basics of 2D games.

This game was my first major breakthrough, where I applied everything I had learned to build a complete game. Drawing inspiration from the iconic Mario series, I wanted to create a side-scroller that would resonate with players while incorporating my unique touch.

Developing Fox Game was a journey filled with challenges—from designing levels, scripting enemy behaviors, to adding Arabic language support for inclusivity. It was an ambitious project for a beginner, but it laid the foundation for my skills and fueled my passion for creating games.

Looking back, this game not only represents my first step into 2D development but also my commitment to creating immersive and accessible gaming experiences. It remains close to my heart as a symbol of my growth and determination in this creative field. 🔥
